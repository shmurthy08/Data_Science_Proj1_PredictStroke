e) PROJECT #1

- No compiler or other errors (everything ran/compiled)

- Referred to the slack #questions channel for clarifications
	- Worked with Rahul Sura for the best visualization ideas and best coding practices (i.e when we should use functions and how we should structure the code) as well as helped each other figure out error issues. Written responses were done individually.
